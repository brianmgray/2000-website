  <li> At lunchtime, sit in your parked car and point a hair dryer at passing cars to see if
    they slow down.</li>
  <li> Page yourself over the intercom. (Don't disguise your voice.) </li>
  <li> Insist that your e mail address be Xena-goddess-of-fire@companyname.com</li>
  <li> Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that. </li>
  <li> Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair dancing. </li>
  <li> Put your garbage can on your desk and label it 'IN.' </li>
  <li> Develop an unnatural fear of staplers. </li>
  <li> Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine
    addictions, switch to espresso. </li>
  <li> In the memo field of all your checks, write &quot;for sexual favors&quot;. </li>
  <li> Reply to everything someone says with, &quot;That's what you think.&quot; </li>
  <li> Finish all your sentences with &quot;In accordance with the prophecy.&quot;</li>
  <li> Adjust the tint on your monitor so that the brightness level lights up the entire

    gender.) </li>

  <li> Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party because you're not
    in the mood. <br>
  </li>
