<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi!&nbsp; My name is Brian and this is my site.&nbsp; I live in
Cleveland, Ohio (well, Bainbridge actually) and am a sophomore at <a href="http://www.kenston.k12.oh.us/khs/khs.htm" target="_top">Kenston High School</a>.
&nbsp;I like lots of different stuff.&nbsp; If you have AOL or AOL Instant Messenger, my
screen name is genius274.&nbsp; IM me.&nbsp; I'm in show choir, marching band, jazz band,
and I do community theater.&nbsp; I play trombone in band and also drum set in my spare
time (like I have a lot of spare time)&nbsp; I worked this summer at Sea World Cleveland
in operations, but I won't next year.&nbsp; It wasn't fun.&nbsp; I am currently a McWorker
and I like it a lot more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have designed not only this site, but also the <a href="http://www.kenston.k12.oh.us/khs/showchoir/show_choir.htm" target="_top">Kenston
Show Choir</a> site and a site for the <a href="http://homes.arealcity.com/LuckyFind" target="_top">Lucky Find Consignment Shop</a> which helps raise money for the Kenston
Music Boosters.&nbsp; I know basic Java (like the random Midi player in the navigation
bar) and am taking a class in C++ at my high school.&nbsp; Also, I am currently in a
production of West Side Story with Beachwood Community Theater.&nbsp; If you live in the
area, or don't, come see it at Beachwood High School on Febuary 11 and 18 at 8:00, Febuary
12 and 19 at 7:30, and Febuary 13 and 20 at 2:00.</p>
