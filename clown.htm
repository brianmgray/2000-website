Clown</u></strong></font></p>

<ol>
  <li>By the end of the party, he's got every damn kid doing the &quot;pull my finger&quot;
    trick. </li>
  <li>Clown car must be started with breathalyzer device. </li>
  <li>Keeps screaming, &quot;My name's not BO-zo, it's bo-ZO?&quot; </li>
  <li>References to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are lost on most 5-year olds.</li>
  <li>Props for his &quot;disappearing&quot; trick: a moving van and your wide-screen TV. </li>
  <li>Scares the holy hell outta the kids during the &quot;Severed Limb&quot; trick. Tells the
    kids he killed Barney in a blood match in Newark. </li>
  <li>Didn't bring any balloons, but manages to twist your dachshund into other animal shapes.
  </li>
  <li>Prefaces each trick with, &quot;here's a little number I learned in the joint.&quot; </li>
  <li>Not exactly the Peewee Herman impression you were expecting. </li>
  <li>Wears a T-Shirt that says, &quot;Drug-free since March?&quot; </li>
  <li>More interested in squirting seltzer into his Scotch than into his pants. </li>
  <li>Those huge ears look too darn life-like, and the entire act consists of showing charts
    and complaining about the deficit. </li>
  <li>A sad clown is one thing -- a clown who spends the entire party with a gun to his temple
    is another thing entirely. </li>
  <li>Only balloon animals he can make are a snake and a &quot;snake on acid.&quot;</li>
  <li>Business cards include the phrase &quot;From the Mind of Stephen King...&quot;</li>
  <li>Price list includes &quot;lap dance&quot; and &quot;around the world.&quot; All the
    balloon animals are ribbed and lubricated.</li>
