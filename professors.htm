First Day of Class</u></strong></font></p>

<ol>
  <li>Wear a hood with one eyehole. Periodically make strange gurgling noises. </li>
  <li>After confirming everyone's names on the roll, thank the class for attending
    &quot;Advanced Astrodynamics 690&quot; and mention that yesterday was the last day to
    drop.</li>
  <li>After turning on the overhead projector, clutch your chest and scream &quot;My
    pacemaker!&quot; </li>
  <li>Wear a pointed Kaiser helmet and a monocle and carry a riding crop. </li>
  <li>Gradually speak softer and softer and then suddenly point to a student and scream
    &quot;You! What did I just say!&quot; </li>
  <li>Deliver your lecture through a hand puppet. If a student asks you a question directly,
    say in a high-pitched voice, &quot;The Professor can't hear you, you'll have to ask me,
    Winky Willy.&quot; </li>
  <li>If someone asks a question, walk silently over to their seat, hand them your piece of
    chalk, and ask, &quot;Would you like to give the lecture, Mr. Smartypants?&quot; </li>
  <li>Pick out random students, ask them questions, and time their responses with a stopwatch.
    Record their times in your grade book while muttering &quot;tsk, tsk.&quot; </li>
  <li>Ask students to call you &quot;Tinkerbell&quot; or &quot;Surfin' Bird.&quot; </li>
  <li>Stop in mid-lecture, frown for a moment, and then ask the class whether your butt looks
    fat. </li>
  <li>Play &quot;Kumbaya&quot; on the banjo. </li>
  <li>Show a video on medieval torture implements to your calculus class. Giggle throughout
    it. </li>
  <li>Announce &quot;you'll need this&quot;, and write the suicide prevention hotline number
    on the board. </li>
  <li>Wear mirrored sunglasses and speak only in Turkish. Ignore all questions. </li>
  <li>Start the lecture by dancing and lip-syncing to James Brown's &quot;Sex Machine.&quot; </li>
  <li>Ask occassional questions, but mutter &quot;as if you gibbering simps would know&quot;
    and move on before anyone can answer. </li>
  <li>Ask the class to read Jenkins through Johnson of the local phone book by the next
    lecture. Vaguely imply that there will be a quiz. </li>
  <li>Have one of your graduate students sprinkle flower petals ahead of you as you pace back
    and forth. </li>
  <li>Address students as &quot;worm.&quot; </li>
  <li>Announce to students that their entire grades will be based on a single-question oral
    final exam. Imply that this could happen at any moment. </li>
  <li>Turn off the lights, play a tape of crickets chirping, and begin singing spirituals. </li>
  <li>Ask for a volunteer for a demonstration. Ask them to fill out a waiver as you put on a
    lead apron and light a blowtorch. </li>
  <li>Point the overhead projector at the class. Demand each student's name, rank, and serial
    number. </li>
  <li>Begin class by smashing the neck off a bottle of vodka, and announce that the lecture's
    over when the bottle's done. </li>
  <li>Have a band waiting in the corner of the room. When anyone asks a question, have the
    band start playing and sing an Elvis song. </li>
  <li>Every so often, freeze in mid sentence and stare off into space for several minutes.
    After a long, awkward silence, resume your sentence and proceed normally. </li>
  <li>Wear a &quot;virtual reality&quot; helmet and strange gloves. When someone asks a
    question, turn in their direction and make throttling motions with your hands. </li>
  <li>Mention in passing that you're wearing rubber underwear. </li>
  <li>Growl constantly and address students as &quot;matey.&quot; </li>
  <li>Devote your math lecture to free verse about your favorite numbers and ask students to
    &quot;sit back and groove.&quot; </li>
  <li>Announce that last year's students have almost finished their class projects. </li>
  <li>Inform your English class that they need to know Fortran and code all their essays.
    Deliver a lecture on output format statements. </li>
  <li>Bring a small dog to class. Tell the class he's named &quot;Boogers McGee&quot; and is
    your &quot;mascot.&quot; </li>
  <li>Whenever someone asks a question, walk over to the dog and ask it, &quot;What'll be,
    McGee?&quot; </li>
  <li>Wear a feather boa and ask students to call you &quot;Snuggles.&quot; </li>
  <li>Tell your math students that they must do all their work in a base 11 number system. Use
    a complicated symbol you've named after yourself in place of the number 10 and threaten to
    fail students who don't use it.</li>
  <li>Claim to be a chicken. Squat, cluck, and produce eggs at irregular intervals. </li>
  <li>Bring a CPR dummy to class and announce that it will be the teaching assistant for the
    semester. Assign it an office and office hours. </li>
  <li>Have a grad student in a black beret pluck at a bass while you lecture. </li>
  <li>Sprint from the room in a panic if you hear sirens outside. </li>
  <li>Give an opening monologue. Take two-minute &quot;commercial breaks&quot; every ten
    minutes. </li>
  <li>Tell students that you'll fail them if they cheat on exams or &quot;fake the funk.&quot;
  </li>
  <li>Announce that you need to deliver two lectures that day, and deliver them in rapid-fire
    auctioneer style. </li>
  <li>Pass out dental floss to students and devote the lecture to oral hygiene. </li>
  <li>Announce that the entire 32-volume Encyclopedia Britannica will be required reading for
    your class. Assign a report on Volume 1, Aardvark through Armenia, for next class. </li>
  <li>Ask students to list their favorite showtunes on a signup sheet. Criticize their choices
    and make notes in your grade book. </li>
  <li>Sneeze on students in the front row and wipe your nose on your tie. </li>
  <li>Warn students that they should bring a sack lunch to exams. </li>
  <li>Refer frequently to students who died while taking your class. </li>
  <li>Show up to lecture in a ventilated clean suit. Advise students to keep their distance
    for their own safety and mutter something about &quot;that bug I picked up in the
    field.&quot;<font SIZE="2"> </font></li>
